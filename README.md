# ChatApp

##Theme
For this project I went with a technological theme given that it involves a chatbot that learns from the messages entered on the chat.
The theme was implemented by adding a robot picture to a background that lightly resembles tech.

##Known problems
One of the biggest problems was the inability to properly detect when a user disconnects. The app does not register properly when a client leaves.
Also, the facebook and sign in buttons will retrieve the user's previous login information which can be treated as an auto-login feature after the user signed in once.

##How to improve
Detect the bug that does nto allow the server to notice on time when a user disconnects
